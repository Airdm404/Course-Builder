# Course Builder

Start off by clicking the circular gray '+' button to create an empty schedule.
- name your schedule with a new name that isn't an empty string
- select a concentration/program
- click 'add semester' to add semesters to your plan
- click the "+" button next to 'elective classes' to go to the search view
    - click on the bar at the top to open a sheet that gives a preview list of all subjects. 
        -  input a search in the subject search sheet to search for a particular subject (this works by checking the prefix so search with the subject abbriviations. ie. "AAAS" instead of "African & African Amer Studies")
    - after selecting the subject of your choice (you should see a little check next to the selected subject), check out the classes that are available
        - click the class to see more details
        - swipe left to add it to the electives bin (it should disappear)
- drag a class from 'required classes' or 'elective classes' from the bin to a schedule of your choice (you might have to hold click it to initiate the drag)
    - if you made a mistake or want to remove the class you added to a schedule, do one of the following to send the class back to a bin:
        1. hold down for a second 
        2. swipe left (this might be hard on the simulator)
        3. drag a different class on top of it 
- hit the 'check graduation' button to see if you have fulfilled the graduation requirements for your concentration.
- hit the 'export' button and preview the file, then click either 'save to CoreData' or 'save to Photos' to save your plan to a pdf/image that is accessible on your device's Photos app
- hit 'save' to save your plan your device and exit to the home screen
- hit 'cancel' to undo any changes and exit to the home screen
- (demo only) hit the 'software' or 'hardware' buttons to automatically populate the 'elective classes' bin with the classes you need to graduate.
